The Burrows-Wheeler transform is a simple yet effective method of transforming a string to make it more compressible.
This program allows the user to enter a string; the most commonly used letters in the string are grouped together through the
transformation returning a semi-encrypted string which gets stronger with size. The process can be easily reversed by storing the pointer
which marks the starting position allowing us easy decryption.
